Hello, I am Giorgio Abboud.

I am a rising senior at Florida International University studying Computer Science and minoring in Mathematical Sciences. I have found my passion in cultivating messy data and processing it through an end-to-end pipeline to power real-world applications. I have hands-on experience with Python, PostgreSQL, Docker, Kafka, Spark, and PyTorch.

In addition to my passion, I am a lead teaching assistant for a Java course. I coordinate a team of six TAs, onboard new TAs on our practices, and troubleshoot student issues in our weekly labs. I have also interned as a software engineer at Break Through Tech, focusing on backend Python, where my team and I designed PostgreSQL schemas, the functional Python backend, and wrote Pytest suites to validate endpoint responses.

Outside of class, I am a part of the RiskLab and INIT club at FIU. I also participated in the yearly ShellHacks Hackathon at Florida International University. In 2024, I won 1st place for my team's AI Drawing Classifier, which was a containerized PyTorch CNN with real-time canvas input. Currently, I am also developing a Dockerized Kafka and Spark pipeline that ingests financial news and stock data. The project is being developed, so stay tuned for more to come!

I have recently found my passion in data engineering, scalable cloud architectures, and clean code. I am always open to connecting with fellow engineers, recruiters, or anyone who wants to discuss future career paths!
